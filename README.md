### Haunt & Gather

https://www.hauntandgather.com/

•	This is an in-progress original game emulating the style of classic point & click adventure games.

•	I created the layout of game using Phaser 3, which allows navigation between different “scenes” and interaction with objects within the game.

•	I secured domain name and hosted game using Amplify, part of Amazon Web Services.

•	I am creating all art assets myself, primarily using Adobe Sketch. Some temporary assets are being used while I create permanent ones. These were sketched by hand on paper.

•	All sound assets so far come from Freesound, a free-use sound effects database. This may change as development continues.
